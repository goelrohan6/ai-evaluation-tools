> **The Comprehensive List of AI Evaluation Tools** — a curated, source-linked directory of open-source and commercial software for evaluating AI systems.

**AI evaluation tools** are software platforms, open-source frameworks, metrics libraries, judge models, and benchmarks used to measure the quality, safety, reliability, cost, latency, and task performance of AI systems — large language models (LLMs), RAG pipelines, AI agents, voice agents, and multimodal models. This list covers LLM evaluation tools, LLM testing frameworks, AI evals, evaluation platforms, observability tools, red-teaming tools, guardrails, and model evaluation benchmarks — both **open-source and commercial**, because real-world evaluation stacks almost always combine the two.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-07-16 · **29 categories** · **300+ entries** · **Reviewed monthly** · Machine-readable index: [`data/tools.json`](data/tools.json) / [`data/tools.csv`](data/tools.csv)

Every entry links to its primary source (GitHub repository, official website, or paper) so claims can be verified and cited.

## Full-Stack LLM Evaluation Platforms

A **full-stack LLM evaluation platform** covers the entire evaluation lifecycle in one product: dataset curation, offline benchmarking and experiments, metric management, tracing, online (production) evaluation, human review, and reporting. Platforms differ from [evaluation frameworks](#llm-evaluation-frameworks) (code libraries you run yourself) by adding hosted infrastructure, UI, and collaboration.

## LLM Observability and Tracing

**LLM observability** tools trace, log, and monitor LLM applications in production. Observability differs from evaluation: tracing records what happened, while evaluation scores it — though most tools below support running online evaluations over live traces.

## RAG Evaluation

**RAG evaluation** measures retrieval-augmented generation systems along two axes: retrieval quality (did the system fetch the right context?) and generation quality (is the answer grounded in that context?). Tools here include metric toolkits, diagnostic frameworks, and retrieval benchmarks.

## Long-Context and Memory Evaluation

**Long-context evaluation** tests how well models use very large prompts; **memory evaluation** tests whether agents retain and use information across turns and sessions. These are distinct capabilities: a model can read a million tokens yet still fail to remember facts across a week of conversations.

## Glossary

Short definitions of terms used throughout this list.

- **Eval** — a repeatable test that measures an AI system's behavior against defined criteria; the unit of work in AI evaluation.
- **Golden (golden dataset)** — a curated input (and optionally expected output) used as a test case in evaluation datasets.
- **Metric / scorer** — a function that assigns a score to a model output; can be heuristic (exact match, BLEU), statistical, or model-based (LLM-as-a-judge).
- **LLM-as-a-judge** — using a language model to score another model's outputs against criteria; scalable but subject to position, verbosity, and self-preference biases.
- **G-Eval** — a widely used LLM-as-a-judge algorithm that generates evaluation steps via chain-of-thought and scores with probability weighting.
- **Trace** — a structured record of one execution of an LLM app (prompts, tool calls, retrievals, outputs), used in observability and online evaluation.
- **Online evaluation** — scoring live production traffic (often sampled) rather than a fixed offline test set.
- **Benchmark** — a fixed dataset plus scoring protocol for comparing models (e.g., MMLU, SWE-bench).
- **Leaderboard** — a published ranking of models on one or more benchmarks or on human preference.
- **Benchmark contamination** — benchmark test data leaking into a model's training set, inflating scores.
- **Pass@k** — the probability that at least one of k generated samples passes the tests; standard in code generation.
- **Hallucination** — model output not grounded in the provided context or in reality.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What are AI evaluation tools?**
AI evaluation tools are software platforms, frameworks, metrics libraries, judge models, and benchmarks used to measure the quality, safety, reliability, cost, and performance of AI systems such as LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents. They range from open-source libraries run in CI to hosted platforms that evaluate production traffic.

**What is the difference between an LLM evaluation framework and an LLM evaluation platform?**
A framework (e.g., DeepEval, Ragas, promptfoo) is a code library you run yourself for writing and executing evals. A platform (e.g., Confident AI, Braintrust, LangSmith, Langfuse) adds hosted infrastructure on top: dataset management, experiment comparison UI, tracing, online evaluation, and team collaboration. Many teams use both — a framework in CI and a platform for datasets, reporting, and production monitoring.

**Which LLM evaluation tools are open source?**
Widely adopted open-source options include DeepEval, Ragas, promptfoo, lm-evaluation-harness, Inspect AI, Langfuse, Phoenix, Opik, and OpenCompass. Every entry in this list is marked 🟢 (open source), 🟠 (open weights), 🔵 (open core), or 🔒 (commercial).

**How do you evaluate a RAG pipeline?**
Evaluate the two stages separately, then end to end. Retrieval is measured with context precision/recall or ranking metrics on benchmarks like BEIR; generation is measured with faithfulness/groundedness and answer relevancy metrics (available in Ragas, DeepEval, and TruLens); end-to-end quality is measured on a golden dataset, often generated synthetically from your documents.

**How do you evaluate an AI agent?**
Agent evaluation combines end-to-end task metrics (task completion, success rate) with component-level metrics (tool-call correctness, argument correctness, trajectory quality), typically over traces. Simulation frameworks (LangWatch Scenario, Maxim, Coval for voice) generate multi-turn interactions, while fixed benchmarks (GAIA, tau-bench, SWE-bench, OSWorld) compare underlying models and scaffolds.

**What is LLM-as-a-judge and what are its limitations?**
LLM-as-a-judge uses a strong language model to score outputs against criteria, achieving roughly 80%+ agreement with human preferences (Zheng et al., 2023). Known limitations include position bias, verbosity bias, self-preference, and rubric sensitivity — which is why judge outputs should be spot-checked against human labels and why judge meta-evaluation benchmarks (JudgeBench, LLMBar, RewardBench) exist.

**How do I red-team an LLM application?**
Use an automated red-teaming framework (DeepTeam, garak, PyRIT, promptfoo red teaming) to scan for jailbreaks, prompt injection, PII leakage, and harmful content, then add runtime guardrails (NeMo Guardrails, Guardrails AI, Llama Guard) for the failure modes you find. Standardized benchmarks such as HarmBench and JailbreakBench measure robustness over time.

**How should I cite this list?**
See [Citing This List](#citing-this-list) for a citation template, BibTeX, and the machine-readable `CITATION.cff`. When citing an individual tool, always prefer that tool's own repository, documentation, or paper — linked in each entry — as the primary source.

- **Scope.** Tools whose primary purpose is evaluating, testing, monitoring, red-teaming, or benchmarking AI systems — generative AI first (LLMs, RAG, agents, voice, multimodal), plus classic ML evaluation and monitoring. General MLOps, training, and serving tools are out of scope unless they have first-class evaluation features.
- **Inclusion criteria.** Open-source projects should show activity within roughly the last year or have lasting reference value (canonical benchmarks are kept regardless of age). Commercial products must be generally available. Discontinued tools move to the [historical section](#discontinued-and-historical-tools) rather than being silently removed.
- **Availability markers.** 🟢 Open source (OSI-style license), 🟠 Open weights (downloadable model, restrictive license), 🔵 Open core (open component + commercial platform), 🔒 Commercial. Markers describe the primary linked artifact.
- **Ordering.** Within each category, entries are ordered by the maintainers' editorial judgment of completeness and adoption for that category's use case — not alphabetically and not by any paid placement. There is no sponsored placement on this list.
- **Editorial independence.** This directory is maintained by aglio-lab. Every entry follows the same sourcing, wording, and ordering rules, and no placement is sold.
- **Verification.** Every entry links to a primary source and was manually checked against it as of the **last-reviewed date** at the top of this file. Descriptions aim to be factual and neutral; superlatives are avoided unless attributable to a cited source.
- **Monthly review cadence.** The directory is reviewed during the first week of every month. Maintainers verify primary links, product lifecycle status, names, availability markers, quantitative claims, category coverage, and generated data before advancing the last-reviewed date and publishing a `YYYY.MM` release. A scheduled GitHub workflow opens the checklist; the review itself remains human-verified. See [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md).
- **Corrections.** Errors happen — especially product shutdowns and renames. Open an issue or PR (see [Contributing](#contributing)) and corrections will be applied with priority.
- **Machine-readable data.** The tables in this README are parsed into [`data/tools.json`](data/tools.json) and [`data/tools.csv`](data/tools.csv) by [`scripts/generate_catalog.py`](scripts/generate_catalog.py) for programmatic use.
